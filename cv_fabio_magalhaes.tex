		ThoughtWorks
		\begin{itemize}
      \item Leading international retailer (July 2016 - present) - created an application used by the allocator managers of the brands to allocate products 
        to stores across several markets. The tool presents users with several attributes of each product and helps in the decision making process by presenting 
        sales forecast for products. Also I'm leading the squad (one of the units that composes a team) responsible for automating the measurement of the  effectiveness 
        of our metrics against legacy systems. The system follows a microservice architecture, with services implemented in Java and deployed to an on-premises Pivotal 
        Cloud Foundry environment. The user facing application is web based, Single Page Application, using AngularJS.
      \item Leading international retailer (July 2015 - June 2016) - developed a large scale order routing system responsible for routing e-commerce orders. The system
        also helps remove stranded inventory from stores, making more products available to online customers and increasing profits. Backend application using Java.
      \item Leading US healthcare improvement company (November 2014 - July 2015) - created a web application for reconciliation and contract revenue forecasting used 
        by contract managers. The system made contract revenue more predictable enabling contract managers to take corrective actions sooner. The system was deployed to 
        Amazon Web Services and was composed of a web application using AngularJS, a backend for frontend application implemented in Java and a predictive model 
        implemented in Python.
      \item Large US online marketing and advertising provider (July - October 2014) - implemented a control panel for advertising campaign managers that aids the 
        creation of more effective campaigns in order to optimize user's marketing budgets. Single Page Application using AngularJS and a backend for frontend 
        implemented in Ruby on Rails.
      \item Large Brazilian retailer (May - Jun 2014) - developed a proof of concept of a business intelligence system including data ingestion, data transformation 
        and stock metrics reporting using Hive in the cloud (Amazon EMR).  Interface with legacy systems using Ruby and Oracle 11g.
