# About
This is my curriculum vitae, based on a template designed by Rensselaer Carreer Development Center: http://www.rpi.edu/dept/arc/training/latex/resumes/

There are two files: cv_fabio_magalhaes.tex and res.cls. The .tex file is the CV itself, you may modify it and create your own CV. The .cls is a resume class 
used by the tex template, don't touch it.
